# Breast-cancer-task1
This project focuses on building a binary classification model using Logistic Regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features derived from digitized images of breast masses.

Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset (available via sklearn.datasets), the workflow covers:

## Key Steps ##
Data Loading – Loaded 569 samples with 30 features (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness).

Preprocessing – Standardized features for better model performance.

Model Training – Applied LogisticRegression from Scikit-learn.

Evaluation – Used confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Visualization – Plotted confusion matrix, ROC curve, and sigmoid function to explain decision boundaries.

## Tools Used ##
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Outcome ##
Achieved high classification performance in distinguishing malignant vs. benign cases.

Demonstrated how logistic regression can be interpreted using sigmoid output and probability thresholds.
